# Q&A

##### What is an Autoencoder? What does it "auto-encode"?
##### What were Autoencoders traditionally used for? Why there has been a resurgence of Autoencoders for generative modeling?
##### What is recirculation?
##### What loss functions are used for Autoencoders?
##### What is a linear autoencoder? Can it be optimal (lowest training reconstruction error)? If yes, under what conditions?
##### What is the difference between Autoencoders and PCA 
- [can also be used for reconstruction](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/229092/how-to-reverse-pca-and-reconstruct-original-variables-from-several-principal-com)
##### What is the impact of the size of the hidden layer in Autoencoders?
##### What is an undercomplete Autoencoder? Why is it typically used for?
##### What is a linear Autoencoder? Discuss it's equivalence with PCA. (only valid for undercomplete) Which one is better in reconstruction?
##### What problems might a nonlinear undercomplete Autoencoder face?
##### What are overcomplete Autoencoders? What problems might they face? Does the scenario change for linear overcomplete autoencoders? (identity function)
##### Discuss the importance of regularization in the context of Autoencoders.
##### Why does generative autoencoders not require regularization?
##### What are sparse autoencoders?
##### What is a denoising autoencoder? What are its advantages? How does it solve the overcomplete problem?
##### What is score matching? Discuss it's connections to DAEs.
##### Are there any connections between Autoencoders and RBMs?
##### What is manifold learning? How are denoising and contractive autoencoders equipped to do manifold learning?
##### What is a contractive autoencoder? Discuss its advantages. How does it solve the overcomplete problem?
##### Why is a contractive autoencoder named so? (intuitive and mathematical)
##### What are the practical issues with CAEs? How to tackle them?
##### What is a stacked autoencoder? What is a deep autoencoder? Compare and contrast.
##### Compare the reconstruction quality of a deep autoencoder vs. PCA.
##### What is predictive sparse decomposition?
##### Discuss some applications of Autoencoders.
